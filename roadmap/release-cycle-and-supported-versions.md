# Release Cycle and Supported Versions

### Understanding Version Numbers

Varbase follows Drupal 8 release cycle. Therefore, a version of Varbase that is named 8.x-5.x uses the same **major** version of Drupal 8.x-5.x.

To understand version numbers see the table below:

### Varbase Supported Versions

Varbase supports up to 3 major versions:

* The most recent one using the most recent Drupal 8 major version \(_e.g. `8.x-6.x`_\)
* The one before it \(_e.g. `8.x-5.x`_\)
* And the one before it \(_e.g. `8.x.4.x`_\)

Once the most recent stable version of Drupal 8 is released \(_e.g. `8.x-7.x`_\), Varbase will release its _`8.x-7.x`_ version and drop support of oldest supported version \(_e.g. `8.x.4.x`_\).
